2. Backlog Page (Create / Modify issues)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Open Backlog page by clicking from side-bar

	2. Select Epic as the "Issue type"
	3. Write Epic name:

	3. Write "Summary" of Epic:
	LMS content for "Python Basics" lesson must be prepared prior to the beginning of the course.
	4. Attach files (Can be attached later)

	6. Write "Description" of issue:
	We will prepare an excellent content for "Python Basics" lesson.
	7. Select "Reporter", it automatically assigns you.
	8. Link with other issues (Issue linking allows you
to create an association between two existing issues on either the same or 
different Jira servers. For example: An issue may relate to another. 
An issue may duplicate another.)
	9. Select "Assignee"
	10. Give priority
	11. Add "Labels" (Labels in Jira are tags or keywords 
that you can add to issues to show whether they possess certain 
characteristics. They let you classify issues more flexibly 
and more informally than by assigning version numbers or components.):
	python, lesson
	12. Add "Sprint" to the task which it belongs to. (Later we will add)
	14. Select "Create another" if you want to continue creating issues.
	15. Click "Create".

	5. "Configure fields" of information
	6. Write "Description" of issue:
	In this user story, the user wants to learn  Python Format & Style of Coding.

3. Backlog Page (Create / Start a Sprint)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Click "Create sprint" button on the right side of the Backlog row 
to create new sprint.
#You can drag and drop an issue from backlog to the sprint window
or from one sprint to another and vice versa.
#Once we have user stories, tasks and bugs in our sprint, let's start
the sprint.
#Only one sprint can be started. (The Parallel sprints feature lets you enable 
multiple active sprints that are running in parallel with each other. 
For example, if you have two teams working from the same backlog, each team 
can now work on their own active sprint simultaneously)
#Click "Start sprint" button, which is blue colored. Here you can:
	1. Change sprint name
	2. Change duration (Auto: 2 weeks)
	3. Add start and end date (Only with "custom" duration)

	2. Add people to the sprint
	3. Complete sprint
	4. Edit board settings
#Issues can be replaced by drag and drop.
#Finished issues can be seen marked on the backlog page.
#Complete the sprint, or it will automatically be completed with the time adjusted.
#Issues not done goes to next sprint or backlog as you choose. 
(Be careful about subtasks, if there is a subtask incompleted, you cant complete the sprint.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Epic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of 
smaller stories, or sometimes called “Issues” in Jira. Epics often encompass 
multiple teams, on multiple projects, and can even be tracked on multiple 
boards. Epics are almost always delivered over a set of sprints. 
# Stories, bugs, and tasks are used to describe one single piece of work, 
while epics are used to describe a group of issues that all relate to the same, 
larger body of work.
# "Create Epic" after enabling the epic section in Backlog page.
	1. Write the epic name:
	"Computational Thinking" lesson execution
	2. Write summary:
	"Computational Thinking" lesson execution
# Add issues to the epic by drag and drop. 
# Epic names can be seen on assigned issues. 
# Issues can be filtered by all issues, issues with specific epic, issues 
without epic.
# The color of epic can be customized.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Reports
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Click on "Reports". You will see:
	1. Burndown chart (See example)
