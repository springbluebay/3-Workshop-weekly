# Epic: 
An epic is a set of jobs that can be divided into manageable user stories.
# Story: 
A story is a short requirement written from an end-user perspective./*/
A user story is a short and simplified description of a feature in the system which is being developed.
# Task: 
A task represents the job that needs to be done./*/
So, perhaps the better distinction is that stories contain multiple types of work (e.g., programming, testing, database design, user interface design, analysis, etc.) while tasks are restricted to a single type of work.
A story is something that is generally worked on by more than one person, and a task is generally worked on by "just one person."
# Subtask: 
A subtask can be considered as a smaller piece of a story. 
# Bug: A bug impairs expected functionality of the product.

* Board columns represent the underlying workflow.

* Product Owner determine the relative priority of an issue from the position of issues in the product backlog
